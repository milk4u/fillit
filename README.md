Goals

Fillit does not consist of recoding Tetris, even if itâ€™s still a variant of this game.
The program takes a file as parameter which contains a list of Tetriminos and
arrange them to create the smallest square possible. Main goal is to
find this smallest square in the minimal amount of time, despite a exponentially growing
number of possibilities each time a piece is added.
